FluentCommands supports many different "patterns" in the construction of Command modules. 

The most simple is as follows:

- Create a new Console App (.NET Core) and install the FluentCommands package on NuGet.

- Create a class to contain your Command module, and reference FluentCommands.Commands in your using statements: 

![Class created, using FluentCommands.Commands](https://i.imgur.com/4vvLRfi.png)

- Inherit the `CommandModule<TCommand>` class, referencing your class as `TCommand`:

![CommandModule is referencing MyCommands here.](https://i.imgur.com/Wohyihi.png)

- Create a method with return type (async) `Task`, and one of 5 supported Command Contexts (here, we'll use `MessageContext`):

![This is the structure for a command.](https://i.imgur.com/zkcrEcv.png)

- Use the context to help build your command! Here, we send a simple text message:

![The context contains information about the incoming request(s) going to your client.](https://i.imgur.com/MrfF6aV.png)

_(This can be made *much* more efficient with the `Menu` class, but that's out of scope for this quickstart guide, for now.)_

- Tag your command method with the `CommandAttribute`:

- You're done! All that's left is to start the `CommandService` in your `Main` method (likely located in your `Program` class):

![Please keep your bot token safe](https://i.imgur.com/l24tkww.png)

- Start the application and call the command from your bot.

Well done! You've created your first Telegram bot with FluentCommands!

This is just the very beginning of what you can do with this library: stay tuned for more in-depth documentation and examples.
